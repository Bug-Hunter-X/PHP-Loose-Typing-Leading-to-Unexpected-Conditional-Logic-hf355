# PHP Loose Typing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to loose typing and its impact on conditional statements.  The `bug.php` file contains code that incorrectly handles the return values of a function due to loose comparisons.

The solution, found in `bugSolution.php`, showcases how to correctly handle potential null or false return values using strict comparison operators (`===` and `!==`).

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.php` using a PHP interpreter.
3. Observe the unexpected output.
4. Compare the output with the expected output generated by running `bugSolution.php`.

## Learning Points

This example highlights the importance of using strict comparison operators in PHP to avoid unexpected behavior stemming from loose typing.  Always be mindful of the potential return values of functions and perform thorough checks to ensure your code handles all possibilities correctly.
